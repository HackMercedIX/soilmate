# SoilMate

Soil Mate is a gardening companion project developed during the HackMerced IX hackathon.

The aim of this project is to provide gardeners with a comprehensive platform where they can access all the valuable information and resources to enhance their gardening experience.

Through the utilization of modern web technologies and collaborative efforts, Soil Mate offers a range of features including plant care guides, soil composition and climate analysis, and so much more along with community interaction. We trained our AI model using multiple datasets obtained from Kaggle which includes over 1700 common gardener related Questions and Answers and trained it with that to answer unlimited questions from fellow gardeners.


## Getting Started
To use the application, simply clone the repository and run the following commands in your terminal:

## Install dependencies
npm install

This will install the necessary dependencies and start the development server.

## Run the App
npm start

You can then access the application by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
Once you have the application running, you can type the prompt and the question you want to ask the Gardening Assistant and it will help you by giving the answers according to your texts.

Note that while Soil Mate strives to provide accurate information and resources, gardening practices may vary based on location and individual circumstances. Users are encouraged to consult additional sources and seek expert advice when needed.

We hope you enjoy using Soil Mate and find it helpful in your gardening journey. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us.

This project makes use of the "Vegetables, Herbs, and Edible Flowers" dataset available on data.world, which has been instrumental in providing comprehensive information that underpins many features of SoilMate. The dataset includes a wealth of knowledge on various plant species, optimal growing conditions, maintenance tips, and other invaluable data that has greatly enriched the content and advice dispensed by our AI gardening assistant.

We would like to acknowledge the "PlantsChatbotPTBR" dataset hosted on Hugging Face Datasets, which has been a valuable resource for enhancing the capabilities of Soil Mate, our AI gardening assistant. The dataset provided a rich set of conversational data in Portuguese, which includes interactions about plant care, troubleshooting, and other gardening insights that have been pivotal in training our chatbot to understand and respond to user inquiries effectively. 

We are really grateful for the support and resources we got online, throughout our development.
